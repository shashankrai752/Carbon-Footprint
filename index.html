        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
             Welcome to Carbon Conscious! We're passionate about empowering individuals to make a positive impact on the environment. Our mission is simple: to equip you with the knowledge and tools you need to  *reduce your carbon footprint* and live a more sustainable lifestyle.
            
            <h2>Why Carbon Footprint Matters?</h2>
            
            Climate change is the defining challenge of our generation. Greenhouse gas emissions, primarily carbon dioxide (CO2), are trapping heat in the atmosphere, causing global warming and its devastating consequences. Our daily activities, from transportation to energy consumption, all contribute to this issue.
            
            <h2>Taking Action Together </h2>
            
            By understanding your carbon footprint, you can identify areas for improvement. Carbon Conscious provides a free, easy-to-use calculator that analyzes your habits and translates them into a measurable impact. We go beyond just numbers, offering personalized tips and actionable steps to help you:
            
            <h4>Reduce your carbon footprint* across key areas like transportation, energy use, and consumption. </h4>
            <h4>Make informed choices* about the products you buy and the services you use. </h4>
            <h4>Discover eco-friendly alternatives* that fit your lifestyle and budget. </h4>
